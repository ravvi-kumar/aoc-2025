--- Day 1: Trebuchet?! ---

The Elves quickly load you into a spacecraft and prepare to launch.

The engine requires a specific calibration value, which is found by processing the input data. Each line of the input contains a calibration value that needs to be extracted.

To extract the calibration value, you need to find the first digit and the last digit in each line (in the order they appear), combine them to form a two-digit number, and then sum all these numbers.

For example:
- 1abc2 -> 12
- pqr3stu8vwx -> 38
- a1b2c3d4e5f -> 15
- treb7uchet -> 77

The sum of these calibration values is 12 + 38 + 15 + 77 = 142.

Your task is to:
1. Find the calibration value for each line
2. Sum all calibration values to get the final answer
